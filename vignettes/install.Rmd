## Option 1: install a stable release (recommended).

Download the desired `tar.gz` bundle, then install it either with `install.packages(..., repos = NULL, type="source")` from within R  `R CMD INSTALL` from the Unix/Linux command line.

## Option 2: use `install_github` to install the development version.

install_github("wlandau/fbseqOpenMP")
```

## Option 3: build the development version from the source.

Open a command line program such as Terminal in Mac/Linux and enter the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:wlandau/fbseqOpenMP.git
R CMD build fbseqOpenMP
R CMD INSTALL ...
```

where `...` is replaced by the name of the tarball produced by `R CMD build`.
